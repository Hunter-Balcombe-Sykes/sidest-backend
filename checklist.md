# Partna audit checklist — staged by scale

Six lenses, ordered by priority. Tick each scope group as it completes and the findings are triaged. Every `audit.sh` command writes a dated output file under `audits/<phase>/audit-YYYY-MM-DD-<lens>.md` — each phase gets its own folder via the `--phase` flag baked into every command below. Add `--keep-drafts` to retain the DeepSeek scan output (drafts land in `audits/<phase>/.drafts/`).

**Pick your stage below — don't run everything at once.** Most scaling-focused audits only matter once you're past a certain volume. Running them too early surfaces noise; running them too late means you find scale bugs in production.

---

# STAGE 1 — Before pilot launch (≤ 2 brands, ≤ 16 affiliates)

**You are here.** Goal: ship to a tiny pilot with **no correctness, security, or money-handling bugs**. Scale concerns are deferred — at 16 affiliates, N+1 queries and cache stampede don't manifest.

**14 source-scan runs + 3 external — roughly 2h wall-clock.**

### Source-scan must-do
- [x] **All of Phase 1 Security** (7 runs: SEC-A through G) — a tenant boundary failure is just as catastrophic at 2 brands as at 200.
- [ ] **LIFE-A** — Shopify webhook lifecycle (webhook duplicates happen at any scale)
- [ ] **LIFE-B** — Notifications fan-out + dedup (a bad dedup still double-emails 16 affiliates)
- [ ] **LIFE-D** — Auth / policy gating on financial endpoints (money flows from day 1)
- [ ] **TEST-A** — Financial flow tests (you can't roll back a paid affiliate)
- [ ] **TEST-B** — Webhook idempotency tests
- [ ] **DATA-A** — Migrations (pilot data becomes prod data; FK / orphan bugs compound)
- [ ] **DATA-B** — Models + factories

### External must-do
- [ ] **X1** — `composer audit` + `cd cloudflare-worker && npm audit` (~5 min)
- [ ] **X2** — Supabase RLS review (~30 min — even if just to document "RLS off, application layer is the boundary")
- [ ] **X6** — Backup / restore drill (one restore-to-staging from a snapshot)

### Suggested order (1 week)
| Day | Work | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Day 1 | External X1 + X2 + X6 | 1h |
| Day 2 | Phase 1 Security (SEC-A through G) + triage | 90min + fixes |
| Day 3 | LIFE-A, B, D + triage | 45min + fixes |
| Day 4 | TEST-A, B + write missing tests | 30min + fixes |
| Day 5 | DATA-A, B + triage | 30min + fixes |
| Day 6–7 | Fix anything P0/P1 surfaced above | varies |

### Deferred at this stage (don't run yet)
Phase 3 (Scaling), Phase 4 (Database/queue), LIFE-C/E/F, TEST-C/D/E, DATA-C/D, External X3/X4/X5.

---

# STAGE 2 — Before opening to 5+ brands or ~50 affiliates

**Trigger:** you're moving from a closed pilot to a small open beta. Volume starts mattering — multiple brands writing concurrently, more webhooks, more cache pressure.

**Add on top of Stage 1: ~10 more source-scan runs + 2 external.**

### Source-scan additions
- [ ] **LIFE-C** — Cache invalidation + write-path discipline (multiple writers stress this)
- [ ] **LIFE-E** — Edge vendors (Media / Streaming / Hydrogen / Cloudflare)
- [ ] **LIFE-F** — Schema correctness
- [ ] **CACHE-A, B, C, D** — Full Phase 3 Scaling antipatterns (4 runs)
- [ ] **SCALE-A** — Models + Resources (N+1 starts to bite around brand #3)
- [ ] **SCALE-C** — Services with vendor I/O (Shopify GraphQL points budget matters now)
- [ ] **TEST-C** — Policy + auth coverage
- [ ] **DATA-C** — GDPR / retention paths

### External additions
- [ ] **X3** — Frontend `/ultrareview` (cheap; catches dashboard XSS / token issues before brands are watching)
- [ ] **X4 Scenario 1** — Shopify webhook burst load test (200 brands worth of orders to a dev env — tells you the queue + idempotency story)

### Re-run from Stage 1
- [ ] **Phase 1 Security** — re-run after any auth-touching change since pilot
- [ ] **External X1** — CVE audit (monthly cadence starts here)

### Deferred at this stage
SCALE-B/D/E, TEST-D/E, DATA-D, External X5 (pentest can wait until 10+ brands).

---

# STAGE 3 — Before opening to 20+ brands or ~500 affiliates

**Trigger:** you're going public-ish — directory listings, marketing, real PII volume. Queue throughput, scheduler stampede, vendor budgets all become real.

**Add on top of Stage 2: ~7 more source-scan runs + full external.**

### Source-scan additions
- [ ] **SCALE-B** — Jobs + queue shape (Horizon supervisor sizing matters now)
- [ ] **SCALE-D** — Controllers + edge worker (backpressure on real ingress)
- [ ] **SCALE-E** — Migrations under load (no more 30-second blocking migrations)
- [ ] **TEST-D** — Resource / Form Request structure (PII shape regressions = real users now)
- [ ] **TEST-E** — Migration invariants
- [ ] **DATA-D** — Enum DB ↔ app drift

### External additions
- [ ] **X4** — Full load test suite (all 4 scenarios from `audit-checklist-external.md`)
- [ ] **X5** — Third-party pentest before opening to real public users (~$5–15K AUD, ~2 weeks lead time)
- [ ] **X7** — CI hardening: `composer audit` + `npm audit` + critical-path coverage gates in CI

### Re-run from Stage 1 + 2
- [ ] **Full Phase 1 Security** — re-baseline
- [ ] **Phase 2 Lifecycle** — re-run after any vendor-integration change
- [ ] **External X6** — backup drill (quarterly)

---

# STAGE 4 — Scale target (~200 brands × ~50 affiliates × ~100 orders/year)

**Trigger:** you're approaching the design target. The audits transition from event-driven to cadence-driven.

### Ongoing cadence
- [ ] **Monthly:** rerun all 31 source-scan audits (one phase per week)
- [ ] **Monthly:** `composer audit` + `npm audit`
- [ ] **Quarterly:** full load test suite (X4) — re-baseline
- [ ] **Quarterly:** backup / restore drill (X6)
- [ ] **Annually:** third-party pentest (X5)
- [ ] **On every major change:** re-run the relevant phase before merging to production

### New concerns at this scale
- **Capacity planning** — Redis memory, Postgres connection limits, queue worker counts; needs measured numbers, not pattern matches
- **Multi-region / failover** — Supabase + Laravel Cloud single-region today; flag if this changes
- **Cost monitoring** — vendor API spend, DeepSeek/Sonnet audit spend, observability spend
- **SLO definition + alerting** — Nightwatch already in place; SLO thresholds need tuning to scale

## Phase 3 — Scaling antipatterns (P1, pre-scale must-pass)

Rebuild-on-write, write amplification, weak read-side caching, aggregate-tables-that-should-be-live-queries — the patterns from the commerce-analytics rebuild.

**Lens:** `scripts/audit/lenses/scaling-antipatterns.md` (prefix `CACHE-N`)

- [ ] **CACHE-A — Booking-adjacent services (high-cardinality non-commerce)**
  > NOTE: booking itself is dropped (memory `project_booking_dropped.md`). This group is the high-volume non-commerce ingest paths instead.

    --scope app/Http/Controllers/Api/Professional/Analytics \
    --scope app/Http/Controllers/Api/Internal \
    --scope app/Http/Controllers/Api/Staff
  ```

## Phase 4 — Database & queue scaling (P1, pre-scale must-pass)

N+1 hunting, unbounded result sets, connection scoping, queue shape, vendor rate-limit budgets, scheduler stampede, migration safety, backpressure, memory pressure.

**Lens:** `scripts/audit/lenses/database-and-queue-scaling.md` (prefix `SCALE-N`)

- [ ] **SCALE-A — Models + resources (N+1 + unbounded reads)**
  ```bash
  scripts/audit/audit.sh \
    --phase phase-4-database \
    --lens-file scripts/audit/lenses/database-and-queue-scaling.md \
    --scope app/Models \

    --scope supabase/migrations
  ```

## Phase 5 — Test coverage (P2, safety-net verification)

Find the production paths that the other five lenses flag as risky but the test suite doesn't exercise. A static-analysis audit finds *what could break*; this finds *whether you'll catch it when it does*.

**Lens:** `scripts/audit/lenses/test-coverage.md` (prefix `TEST-N`)

- [ ] **TEST-A — Financial flow tests (highest priority within phase)**
  ```bash
  scripts/audit/audit.sh \
    --phase phase-5-tests \

    --scope tests/Feature/Stripe \
    --scope tests/Feature/Commerce \

    --lens-file scripts/audit/lenses/test-coverage.md \
    --scope tests/Feature \
    --scope app/Http/Resources \
    --scope app/Http/Requests
  ```

- [ ] **TEST-E — Migration invariants**
  ```bash

    --scope tests/Feature/Audit \
    --scope tests/Feature/Migrations \
    --scope supabase/migrations \
    --scope database/factories
  ```

## Phase 6 — Data integrity & privacy (P2, foundational hardening)

FK hygiene, soft-delete coherence, orphan-row risk, PII inventory + retention, GDPR redact path completeness, enum / CHECK / UNIQUE coverage.

**Lens:** `scripts/audit/lenses/data-integrity-and-privacy.md` (prefix `DATA-N`)

- [ ] **DATA-A — Migrations (source of truth)**
  ```bash
  scripts/audit/audit.sh \
    --phase phase-6-data \
    --lens-file scripts/audit/lenses/data-integrity-and-privacy.md \
    --scope supabase/migrations
  ```

- [ ] **DATA-B — Models + factories**
  ```bash
  scripts/audit/audit.sh \
    --phase phase-6-data \
    --lens-file scripts/audit/lenses/data-integrity-and-privacy.md \
    --scope app/Models \
    --scope database/factories
  ```

- [ ] **DATA-C — GDPR / retention paths**
  ```bash
  scripts/audit/audit.sh \
    --phase phase-6-data \
    --lens-file scripts/audit/lenses/data-integrity-and-privacy.md \
    --scope app/Http/Controllers/Api/Webhooks \
    --scope app/Jobs/Gdpr \
    --scope app/Services
  ```

- [ ] **DATA-D — Enums (DB ↔ app drift)**
  ```bash
  scripts/audit/audit.sh \
    --phase phase-6-data \
    --lens-file scripts/audit/lenses/data-integrity-and-privacy.md \
    --scope app/Enums \
    --scope supabase/migrations
  ```

## Working notes

- **Output files** land at `audits/<phase>/audit-YYYY-MM-DD-<lens-slug>.md` via the `--phase` flag baked into every command. After triage, mark closed audits with a `-closed` suffix or move to `audits/<phase>/closed/`. Drafts (when `--keep-drafts` is set) land in `audits/<phase>/.drafts/`. To park existing root-level audits, run `mkdir -p audits/phase-0-pre-pipeline && mv audit-*.md audits/phase-0-pre-pipeline/` (only after confirming the orchestrator's glob handles subfolders).
- **Findings are draft until adjudicated.** The DeepSeek scan emits `[DRAFT, confidence: 0.X]` markers; the Sonnet adjudicator re-tiers and dedupes before writing the final file.
- **Per-phase order matters.** Phase 1+2 catch failures that ship bad behaviour to real users. Phase 3+4 catch failures that break under load. Phase 5 is durability hardening — important but not pilot-blocking.
- **Run lenses in parallel within a phase** if you want to compress wall-clock time; each invocation is independent.
- **Triage workflow.** Each finding has a checkbox in the output file. Tick as fixes ship, just like `audit-2026-05-09-stripe-payout-lifecycle.md`.
- **Out-of-scope flags.** Each lens carries its own "do NOT re-flag" section — booking / Fresha / Square / already-closed audits stay out by design.
- **Cost.** DeepSeek scan is the dominant cost; adjudication runs through the local `claude` CLI's OAuth, so no extra billing beyond your usage. Roughly proportional to scope file count × file size.
