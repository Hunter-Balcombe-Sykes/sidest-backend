/**
 * V2: Authorization for `core.partna_staff` records.
 *
 * Doctrine:
 *   - `view`   — admin may view any staff record; support may only view their own.
 *   - `update` — admin only, AND must not be self. Self-promotion / self-demotion
 *                is forbidden at the policy layer; role changes flow only via
 *                PartnaStaff::promoteToAdmin() and demoteToSupport() from an
 *                authorized endpoint.
 *   - `delete` — admin only, AND must not be self. Prevents an admin from
 *                accidentally locking the org out of admin access.
 *
 * Actor type is PartnaStaff (not Professional). This policy never calls
 * denyIfPendingDeletion — staff records have no pending_deletion state.
 *
 * 404 vs 403: this policy returns 404 (`denyAsNotFound`) for non-existent /
 * non-self lookups by support staff, to avoid leaking which staff IDs exist.
 * Admin actions that fail role gates return false → Laravel renders 403,
 * which is the correct signal for "you're authenticated as staff but lack
 * the privilege for this action."
