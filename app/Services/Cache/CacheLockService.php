/**
 * Single-flight cache regeneration helper with jitter and stale-while-revalidate.
 *
 * Wraps Laravel's Cache::remember with a Cache::lock so that under concurrent
 * load only one request rebuilds an expired value while others wait and read
 * the freshly-filled cache. Models the proven pattern in
 * SiteCacheService::getPublicSitePayload.
 *
 * Use this for any cached value that:
 *   - is hot (likely to be requested concurrently when it expires), AND
 *   - is expensive to regenerate (multiple DB queries, joins, external calls).
 *
 * Two methods, depending on whether the closure can return null:
 *   - rememberLocked()         — closures that always return a non-null value
 *   - rememberLockedNullable() — closures that can return null (e.g. lookups that
 *                                may not find a row); uses a sentinel so cached
 *                                nulls survive across requests instead of triggering
 *                                a fresh DB hit each time.
 *
 * Cache hardening features (rememberLocked only):
 *   - TTL jitter ±20% on every int TTL write, preventing thundering-herd expiry.
 *   - Stale-while-revalidate (SWR): stores a long-lived stale copy alongside the
 *     primary key. On stale (primary expired, stale present), returns last-good
 *     immediately without blocking. The next caller that acquires the lock will
 *     recompute and fill the primary key for all subsequent readers.
 *   - Lock keys live on the 'cache_locks' Redis DB (via lock_connection in
 *     config/cache.php) so Cache::flush() on the data DB never releases held locks.
