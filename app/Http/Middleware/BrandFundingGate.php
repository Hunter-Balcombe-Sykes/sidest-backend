// V2: Funding gate for brand-side affiliate-invite write endpoints. The
// brand can't push their first invite into the wild without a card on
// file, because every commission payout that affiliate generates becomes
// the brand's funding obligation. Without this gate, the platform absorbs
// the float for any brand who lapses on Stripe before the first payout
// settles.
//
// NOTE: This is an "on-file" check — it verifies our DB columns are
// non-null, not a live Stripe authorise. To keep this accurate, the
// payment_method.detached Stripe webhook nullifies stripe_payment_method_id
// proactively when a brand removes their card at Stripe. There is a small
// window between detachment and webhook delivery; acceptable given low
// invite frequency and Stripe's sub-second webhook delivery in practice.
//
// Returns 402 Payment Required with a structured payload so the
// dashboard can surface the funding-gate dialog without parsing prose.
// Non-brand callers pass through — only brand professional types own
// invite endpoints, so a 402 here would be misleading for staff or
// affiliate JWTs that hit the route in error.
//
// Apply via route middleware: `->middleware('brand-funding-gate')`.
