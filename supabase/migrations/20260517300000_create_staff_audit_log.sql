-- File: supabase/migrations/20260517300000_create_staff_audit_log.sql
-- OPS-2: Platform audit log of every staff write. One row per POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE
-- against /staff/* routes. Append-only. RLS: staff-read only.
--
-- Body capture is deliberately omitted; payload_summary holds route bindings only.
-- Body detail can be added per-endpoint later via StaffAuditService::record().
--
-- impersonator_staff_id is nullable today and always NULL until OPS-1 (impersonation)
-- ships. Including the column from day one avoids a backfill later.
--
-- FK pattern mirrors core.professional_deletion_audit:
--   * ON DELETE SET NULL on both staff_id and professional_id
--   * *_snapshot text columns so audit rows survive hard-deletes
-- so the audit row is still legible after the actor or target is gone.

-- Append-only is enforced at THREE layers (belt-and-suspenders, because the
-- schema-level grant in 20260403000000_v2_baseline.sql gives app_backend
-- UPDATE/DELETE on every core.* table by default — that grant alone would
-- allow accidental mutation of audit rows despite RLS intent):
--   1. Split RLS policies: FOR INSERT + FOR SELECT, never FOR ALL.
--   2. Explicit REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE — overrides the schema-level grant.
--   3. A BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE trigger that raises unconditionally —
--      survives any future migration that re-grants privileges or replaces
--      the RLS policies. Mirrors commerce.order_events append-only discipline.
--
-- This is stricter than the existing core.*_audit tables (which use FOR ALL
-- and lean on application discipline). Tightened in response to SCHEMA-1 in
-- audits/ops-2-plan-audit/audit-2026-05-17-full.md.
